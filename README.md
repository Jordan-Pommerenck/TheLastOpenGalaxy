# TheLastOpenGalaxy

The Last Open Galaxy Game Playlist on YouTube is a playlist of 4K videos dedicated to showing the creative process behind the entire 
game's continuing development. As the name suggests, The Last Open Galaxy is a game concept centered around the user being able to explore 
the galaxy, engage in 1st or 3rd person space combat, grow wealth through trade, and build their fleet.

The game will be freely available on both Steam and GOG. The source code is available on GitHub.  A Discord channel is available for users 
wishing to get involved on the project or to develop mods for the game.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
